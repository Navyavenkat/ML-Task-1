# ML-Task-1
# Build a Text Classification Model for Sentiment Analysis
# Algorithm
# Step-1
  Load the dataset and preprocess method
# Step-2
  Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Step-3
  Implement a simple linear regression model using libraries like scikit-learn
or TensorFlow.
# Step-4
  Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the
testing set using appropriate metrics 
# Step-5
  Visualize the regression line along with the actual data points using
matplotlib or any other suitable visualization library.
# Output
# Accuracy
